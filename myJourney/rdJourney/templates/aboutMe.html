        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p><strong>Name:</strong> Rinchen</p>
        <p><strong>Age:</strong> 21 </p>
        <p><strong>College:</strong> Samtse College of Education </p>
        <p><strong>Course:</strong> Computer Science </p>

        <p>My name is Rinchen, and I am a college student who enjoys learning new things and exploring
            creative ideas. I am a hardworking and curious person who always tries to give my best in everything I do. I
            believe that every experience, whether good or bad, helps me grow and understand life better. I like working
            with
            others, sharing ideas, and learning from different people. I am also someone who values kindness, honesty,
            and
            positivity. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with friends, reflecting on my goals, and finding ways to
            improve myself. I believe that success doesn’t come overnight, it comes through patience, effort, and a
            positive
            attitude.
